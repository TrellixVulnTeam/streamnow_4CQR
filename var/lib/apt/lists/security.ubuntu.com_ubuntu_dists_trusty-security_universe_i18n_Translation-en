Package: capnproto
Description-md5: 91e7c63080dfa6da83ea260ce539593f
Description-en: tool for working with the Cap'n Proto data interchange format
 Similar to Protocol Buffers, Cap'n Proto is an efficient means of
 serializing structured data to be transferred across a network or
 written to disk. Users write a Cap'n Proto definition file that
 drives a code generator, which in turn emits C++ code for encoding &
 decoding messages in the Cap'n Proto format.
 .
 In addition to being extremely fast, Cap'n Proto also smooths over some
 of the rougher aspects of Protocol Buffers & introduces a number of new
 features to boot.
 .
 This package contains a small suite of tools for developing & maintaining
 your Cap'n Proto schema files, including a code generator for compiling
 your schema files to supported languages.

  * Introduces two metadata files with various bits of project information.
  * Fetches and builds your project's dependencies.
  * Invokes rustc or another build tool with the correct parameters to build
    your project.
  * Introduces conventions, making working with Rust projects easier.

 This program extracts text from MS-Word files, trying to preserve
 as many special printable characters as possible. catdoc supports
 everything up to Word-97. Also supported are MS Write documents and RTF
 files.
 .
 It doesn't even try to preserve fancy Word formatting, because
 Word users usually don't care about document structure, and it is
 this very thing which is important to LaTeX users.
 .
 Also provided is xls2csv, which extracts data from Excel spreadsheets
 and outputs it in comma-separated-value format and catppt, which extracts
 data from PowerPoint presentations.
 .
 This package suggests tk because it also includes wordview, an
 optional Tk-based GUI for catdoc.  The MIME config provided in this
 package will use wordview if X is running, or catdoc directly if it
 is not.

 .
 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.
 .
 chronyc: This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within
 the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only

Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, OCaml bindings
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      he sees are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation

 Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging Library toolkit
 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      he sees are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.

 Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
 that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
 any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
 HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
 development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
 easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
 programs are COM components only available on Windows.

 PhpMailer implements the same methods (object calls) that the Windows-based
 components do.
 .
 Class Features:
  - Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
  - Redundant SMTP servers
  - Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
  - Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
  - Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM)
    component
  - SMTP authentication
  - Native language support
  - Word wrap

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-md5: b9c201f42c4b4fea02c357189015a9c0
Description-en: low level cryptographic library (binary tools)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:
 .
    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudo-random stream, using the Knuth
      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudo-random generator.
    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp
      syntax.
    - pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.
    - nettle-hash - command-line tool to compute message digests such as SHA-1.

Description-md5: 8a851a81a172dd16a4bcbeb1f8f3c4ab
Description-en: build and execute command lines from standard input in parallel
 GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
 or more machines. A job is typically a single command or a small
 script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
 typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, or
 a list of tables.
 .
 If you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use. If
 you write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
 replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running jobs in
 parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU Parallel will
 often make the command easier to read.
 .
 GNU Parallel also makes sure output from the commands is the same
 output as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This
 makes it possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other

Package: python-dbusmock
Description-md5: 3629dacf014f3c6c1882a79a79cbda2d
Description-en: mock D-Bus objects for tests (Python 2)
 With python-dbusmock you can easily create mock objects on D-Bus. This is
 useful for writing tests for software which talks to D-Bus services such as
 upower, systemd, ConsoleKit, gnome-session or others, and it is hard (or
 impossible without root privileges) to set the state of the real services to
 what you expect in your tests.
 .
 Mock objects look like the real API (or at least the parts that you actually
 need), but they do not actually do anything (or only some action that you
 specify yourself). You can configure their state, behaviour and responses as
 you like in your test, without making any assumptions about the real system
 status.
 .
 You can use this with any programming language, as you can run the mocker as a
 normal program. The actual setup of the mock (adding objects, methods,
 properties, etc.) all happen via D-Bus methods on the
 org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface. You just don't have the convenience
 D-Bus launch API that way.

 A declarative layer on top of SQLAlchemy. It is a fairly thin wrapper, which
 provides the ability to define model objects following the Active Record
 design pattern, and using a DSL syntax similar to that of the Ruby on Rails
 ActiveRecord system.

 Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemy's core features, but instead
 focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
 not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemy's manual mapper definitions.
 .
 Elixir is intended to replace the ActiveMapper SQLAlchemy extension, and the
 TurboEntity project.

Package: swift
Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks.

Package: tenshi
Description-md5: bca1e1d99b2be724185f9beefa4984ee
Description-en: log monitoring and reporting tool
 Tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files
 for lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches.
 The regular expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval
 and a list of mail recipients.
 .
 Queues can be set to send a notification as soon as there is a log line
 assigned to it, or to send periodic reports.
 .
 Additionally, uninteresting fields in the log lines (such as PID numbers) can
 be masked with the standard regular expression grouping operators ( ).
 This allows cleaner and more readable reports. All reports are separated by
 hostname and all messages are condensed when possible.
 .
 The program reads a configuration file and then forks a daemon for monitoring
 the specified log files.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Description-en: Shibboleth plugin for WordPress
 This plugin is designed to support integrating your WordPress blog into
 your existing identity management infrastructure using a Shibboleth
 Service Provider.
 .
 WordPress can be configured so that all standard login requests will be
 sent to your configured Shibboleth Identity Provider or Discovery Service.
 Upon successful authentication, a new WordPress account will be
 automatically provisioned for the user if one does not already exist.
 User attributes (username, first name, last name, display name, nickname,
 and email address) can be synchronized with your enterprise's system of
 record each time the user logs into WordPress.
 .
 Finally, the user's role within WordPress can be automatically set (and
 continually updated) based on any attribute Shibboleth provides. For
 example, you may decide to give users with an eduPersonAffiliation value
 of faculty the WordPress role of editor, while the eduPersonAffiliation
 value of student maps to the WordPress role contributor. Or you may choose
 to limit access to WordPress altogether using a special
